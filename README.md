2. Set up python, virtualenv and pip. [Reference to set up on windows](http://www.tylerbutler.com/2012/05/how-to-install-python-pip-and-virtualenv-on-windows-with-powershell/)
3. Activate virtualenv - $ `source env/activate`
4. Create a local_settings.py file within /gapelia/gapelia/ where settings.py is kept.
5. Install dependencies: $ `./bin/pip install -r requirements.pip`
